        "DOSSIER_001: Most people in town saw him as the perfect student, the perfect athlete, the perfect friend. He was the golden boy that everyone trusted implicitly. But Owen saw something else—a calculated coldness behind that practiced smile. While the rest of the world was blinded by the charm of <span class='redact' onclick='revealName(this, 1)'>ZAC</span>, Owen was busy cataloging the moments where the mask slipped. He didn't realize that by watching the hunter, he had become the prey.",
        "DOSSIER_002: Owen vanished on a Tuesday evening after leaving the library. His car was found three miles away in a ditch, engine still warm, but Owen was gone. There were no signs of a struggle, no fingerprints, and no witnesses. The security footage showed a dark figure following him into the unlit section of the lot. That figure, moving with a predatory confidence that only one person possessed, was <span class='redact' onclick='revealName(this, 2)'>ZAC</span>. The police called it a 'missing persons' case; Owen knew it was a kidnapping.",
        "DOSSIER_003: The search parties combed the woods for weeks, ignoring the obvious. They never checked the old storm cellar hidden beneath the floorboards of the guest house owned by <span class='redact' onclick='revealName(this, 3)'>ZAC</span>.

Owen spent the first forty-eight hours in total darkness, listening to the heavy footsteps pacing above his head, knowing exactly who was standing on the other side of the hatch.",
        "DOSSIER_004: We found Owen's broken glasses in a trash bin behind the gym, hidden deep beneath layers of waste. They were twisted and stained with copper-scented residue. When we checked the lockers, we found a pair of black tactical gloves inside the gym bag of <span class='redact' onclick='revealName(this, 4)'>ZAC</span>. He didn't even flinch when we showed them to him. He just smiled that golden-boy smile and told us Owen had probably just run away from the pressure.",
        "DOSSIER_005: The basement was finally uncovered by a tip that came too late. Inside, they found a single chair bolted to the floor and a series of cameras mounted in the corners. It wasn't just a prison; it was a stage. On the workbench were dozens of polaroids of Owen in various states of distress, each one dated and signed in the handwriting of <span class='redact' onclick='revealName(this, 5)'>ZAC</span>. He wasn't just holding Owen; he was documenting the breaking of a human spirit.",
